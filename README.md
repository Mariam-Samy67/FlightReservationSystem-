# FlightReservationSystem-
A simple Java console-based Flight Reservation System.   It allows users to view a seat map (5x4 grid), reserve seats with validation, and prevents double-booking.   The project demonstrates key Java concepts: 2D arrays, nested loops, encapsulation, LocalDate/DateTimeFormatter, command-line arguments, and menu-driven interaction.
